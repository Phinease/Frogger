    Frogger is an arcade game from the 80s, having undergone various adaptations since. The
    goal is to make a frog cross a street while avoiding the cars which circulate there.
    This project offers you to code a similar basic game. The goal will be to bring
    a “frog” from the bottom of the game window to the top of it. The screen will consist
    of a series of lines. The first line is the start line, and contains nothing else
    than the frog (at the start of the game, and when it returns). The last line is
    Also empty, and reaching it wins the game. Between the two, each line represents
    a lane of the road, containing cars of size 1 to 3 (contiguous blocks) moving from
    left to right or right to left, and all cars in the same lane move
    at the same speed. New cars appear at random moments early
    of the line. The player directs the frog with the 4 arrows on the keyboard. A collision with
    a car causes a defeat.

Run:
```bash
java -jar ./Project_JAVA.jar
